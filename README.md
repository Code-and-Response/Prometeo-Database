## Setting up the solution

### Locally using Docker

Step 1: Set the environment variable
All commands shown below use the environment variable MDB_PASSWORD that contains the MariaDB password. You should change it to your own secure password.
```
❯ export MDB_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw
```

Step 2: Run the container
MariaDB is available as an image on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/). Use the following command to download the image and run a container. The command also mounts the following directories to persist the data and store the data configuration:
- $PWD/data:/home - load the sql dump
- $PWD/mdbdata:/var/lib/mysql - store data
- $PWD/mdbconfig:/etc/mysql/conf.d - store configuration

If you use `mdbdata` and `mdbconfig`, you will have to create the directories. 

```
❯ docker run --name mariadb -v $PWD/data:/home -v $PWD/mdbdata:/var/lib/mysql -v $PWD/mdbconfig:/etc/mysql/conf.d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${MDB_PASSWORD} -p 3306:3306 -d mariadb
```

You can check the sql file was mounted by using the following command:

```
❯ docker exec -it mariadb ls /home
pyrrha.sql
```

You can now execute mysql commands as shown here:
```
❯ docker exec -t mariadb mysql -uroot -p${MDB_PASSWORD} -e 'show databases;'
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| data               |
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
+--------------------+
```

Step 3: Load the sql data

Set the `log_bin_trust_function_creators` flag to 1 in order to successfully create the stored procedures without having a SUPER privilege.
```
❯ docker exec -t mariadb mysql -uroot -p${MDB_PASSWORD} -e 'SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;'
```

You can now load the .sql file as follows:
```
❯ docker exec -t mariadb mysql -uroot -p${MDB_PASSWORD} -e 'source /home/pyrrha.sql;'
```

Step 4: Verify the database

You should be able to see the Pyrrha database:

```
❯ docker exec -t mariadb mysql -uroot -p${MDB_PASSWORD} -e 'show databases;'
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| data               |
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| pyrrha             |
+--------------------+
```

You can also list all the tables in the pyrrha database:
```
❯ docker exec -t mariadb mysql -uroot -p${MDB_PASSWORD} -e 'use pyrrha; show tables;'
+------------------------------+
| Tables_in_pyrrha             |
+------------------------------+
| event_types                  |
| events                       |
| events_firefighters_devices  |
| feedback                     |
| firefighter_sensor_log       |
| firefighter_status_analytics |
| firefighters                 |
| fuel_types                   |
| sensors                      |
| status                       |
| user_types                   |
| users                        |
+------------------------------+
```

You are ready to go! You can talk to the database by using localhost:3306.

### IKS (IBM Kubernetes Service)

Step 1: Sign up for [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) or log in with your existing account.

Step 2: Create an IBM Kubernetes Cluster (IKS) from the [catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/create).

Step 3: Add [IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/content/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin-51baa72d-be9b-487a-8e77-02577d2b5b21-global) from the catalog to your cluster in the default namespace. You need this plugin to use persistance volumes and persistance volume claims on IKS. 

Step 4: Log into your cluster by following these [steps](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-access_cluster)

You can verify that you have the correct context by using this command:
```
❯ kubectl config current-context
```
You should see an output like `<cluster_name>/<cluster_ID>`.

Step 5: Add password to `kubernetes/mariadb-secret.yaml` file. You need to get the base 64 encoded password first by using the following command:
```
❯ echo -n ${MDB_PASSWORD} | base64
```
There are three passwords in the secret yaml file. You can create different passwords for each one.
- mariadb-root-password:
- mariadb-replication-password:
- mariadb-user-password:

Step 6: Add bitnami helm repo locally
```
❯ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

Step 7: Apply the secret file `kubernetes/mariadb-secret-sample.yaml`. The pods will not run unless you apply this secret with the correct base64 encoded credentials.

```
❯ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/mariadb-secret-sample.yaml
secret/mariadb created
```
You can verify that the secret was created successfully.

```
❯ kubectl get secret
NAME                            TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
mariadb                         Opaque                                3      2m33s
```


Step 8: Apply the helm chart with the `values-production.yaml` file.

```
❯ helm install mariadb bitnami/mariadb -f kubernetes/values-production.yaml

NAME: mariadb
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Dec 30 14:43:07 2020
NAMESPACE: staging
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Please be patient while the chart is being deployed
```

You should see the primary and secondary pods running after some time. The chart first creates the persistent volume claims first before creatings the pods and services

```
❯ kubectl get pods
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mariadb-primary-0     1/1     Running   0          8m18s
mariadb-secondary-0   1/1     Running   0          8m18s
```

Step 9: Copy the sql data file to the primary pod.

```
❯ kubectl cp data/pyrrha.sql mariadb-primary-0:/tmp/pyrrha.sql
```

Check if the file is present in the container
```
❯ kubectl exec -it mariadb-primary-0 -- ls /tmp
pyrrha.sql
```

Step 10: Load the data into the database.

First, set permissions so your can load the sql without having root privileges:
```
❯ kubectl exec mariadb-primary-0 -- mysql -uroot -p${MDB_PASSWORD} -e 'SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;'
```

Next, load the sql file
```
❯ kubectl exec -it mariadb-primary-0 -- mysql -uroot -p${MDB_PASSWORD} -e 'source /tmp/pyrrha.sql;'
```

You just deployed MariaDB On IBM Cloud Kubernetes Services and loaded the pyrrha tables and stored procedures. You can see the tables with the following command:

```
❯ kubectl exec mariadb-primary-0 -- mysql -uroot -p${MDB_PASSWORD} -e 'use pyrrha; show tables'
```

```
Tables_in_pyrrha
event_types
events
events_firefighters_devices
feedback
firefighter_sensor_log
firefighter_status_analytics
firefighters
fuel_types
sensors
status
user_types
users
```

## Uninstall MariaDB
Remove the helm chart
```
helm uninstall mariadb
```

Remove the persistent volume claims:
```
kubectl delete pvc data-mariadb-primary-0

kubectl delete pvc data-mariadb-secondary-0
```

Remove the secret:
```
kubectl delete secret mariadb
```
